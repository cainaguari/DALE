# DALE
Digital MIDI controllers using Arduino.

DALE is a set of MIDI controllers open source, controlled by Arduino. The whole project is composed of four modules, wich can work together or one by one. This makes the project customizable and fully adaptable to its user.

Here you can find all the files you need to make your own, a set of inexpensive customizable controllers to work on your tracks, or simply have fun.

This is a part of my graduation project, so it's open source to download. But, if you make your own, tell me! I'll be very happy to se my project becoming another one.

You'll find here:
- a list of necessary materials to do it at home;
- the codes to control Arduinos;
- the laser cut files;
- the 3D print file to do the knobs and all things you will want;
- the electrical system connections.

If you have questions about this project, contact me! I'll be glad to help you.

I hope you enjoy it!
