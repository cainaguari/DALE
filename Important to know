THE COMUNICATION ISSUE

The Arduino has a communication protocol called Serial. This is what makes Arduino "talk" with your Windows computer.

When you make a MIDI controller, the communication system changes. In this case, what now makes the comunication between Arduino 
and your Windows is MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface). So, you will need a translator to make your computer
understand Arduino.

And this translator is Hairless MIDI. You will ever need this open when Arduino is connected to Windows talking in MIDI.
